# ESG Responsive Legal Agreements


Hackathon Submission for Hedera Hackathon 2023 in the Sustainability Category

The Smart Legal Contract code created for this hackathon is available from 

This project uses ESG related clauses from [The Chancery Lane Project](https://chancerylaneproject.org/) and will fetch data from [OpenESG](https:///www.openesg.com) (when an API and is available) to compare ESG commitments in contracts to actual values from external verified sources. The project uses the output from the Smart Legal Contract to enforce obligations such as payment deductions or donations to charity.
